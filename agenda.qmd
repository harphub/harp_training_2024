title: Agenda
---
Each day will be split into a morning and afternoon session, with a tea / coffee 
break in the middle of each session. 

For the most part, instruction will be "code-along" sessions with the instructor
with an opportunity to go through some of your own work and / or problems in the 
second half of the week. 

## Day 1: 4 March 2024
### 13:30 - 17:00 
#### [_Introduction and Getting started_](get-started.qmd)

We will give a brief introduction to harp and R and

#### [_Basic reading of data_](read-forecast.qmd)

Andrew will introduce the `read_forecast()` function and go through reading data 
in _Grib_, _NetCDF_ and _vfld_ formats. We will look at how to deal with complex 
lagged forecasting systems and how to transform gridded data to geographic 
point locations

## Day 2: 5 March 2024
### 09:00 - 12:30
#### _Point Verifcation Workflow_

Andrew will go through the workflow for verifying point forecasts. From basic 
preparation of the observations, through to reading the forecasts and computing
and plotting the verification scores. The complexity will be increased by 
grouping the data with the `groupings` argument and adding conditions to the 
verification

### 13:30 - 17:00
#### _Building a Verification Script_

Andrew will build on the morning's work by converting our verification workflow 
into a script that could be run in a production environment. We will cover how 
to loop over different forecast parameters, how to deal with harp's non-standard 
evaluation by embracing variables with `{{ }}` and then discuss some real uses 
of harp point verification in an operational environment.
